                <p>The supposed gains are many: time saved, consistency improved, feedback accelerated. But the losses may be harder to measure. The professor who noticed a student's voice emerging. The comment that asked exactly the right question. The human recognition that said: <em>I see you. I'm paying attention. Your thinking matters to me.</em></p>
                <p>These things don't scale. Perhaps that's the point.</p>
